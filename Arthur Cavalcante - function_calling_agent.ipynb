{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Agentes com Autogen - Function Calling - Hands-On\n","\n","Agradecimento ao professor Julio Cesar dos Reis pelo material.\n","\n","## Descrição\n","\n","Exploramos a implementação de agentes simples utilizando a biblioteca Autogen. O objetivo é demonstrar como configurar e interagir com agentes capazes de executar tarefas automatizadas de forma eficiente. Aprenderemos a estruturar prompts, configurar agentes com diferentes especializações e testar interações dinâmicas entre eles.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"8vgyXx0vadbJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ihsTM02Dablq","outputId":"72d223ae-be32-407a-83fc-74c576055923","collapsed":true,"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741263189790,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":26847,"user":{"displayName":"Arthur
